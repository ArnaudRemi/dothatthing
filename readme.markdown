## About the project

DTT is born from a real problem with todos. Although there are lots of great todo apps, short term and daily todos always end up on the side of a paper sheet, a post it, or whatever's under your eyes frequently. The reason is that a todo needs to be constantly monitored. Using chrome extensions to replace home page of new tabs can be a very good alternative for this specific problem. That's how Do That Thing was born!

Why the name "Do That Thing"? Because of this https://youtu.be/WsqdmqRgrIc?t=54s


## Installation

#### 1. Download ZIP
Download the ZIP of the project, once done unzip.

#### 2. Enable Developer mode on Google Chrome
Go to the extension manager (chrome://extensions/) and tick the box "Developer mode" on the top right.

#### 3. Load the unzip folder
